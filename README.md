1. Tic-tac-toe:

A simple, command-line based tic-tac-toe game, playable on a single computer in multiplayer mode, from 2 up to 4 players. CPU player isn't available at the
moment.
The width and length of the playfield can be adjusted from 3x3 until 15x15. It is not neccessary to have the same width as length. Also, the winning number
can be adjusted from 3 to 15.
Each player can choose itself a custom symbol, that will appear on the field after placing a symbol. The hits will be counted horizontally, vertically and
diagonally. The player who can place as many symbols in these directions - without interruption - as the winning number has defined, as first, wins.
The game can be replaced as many times as wished. Have fun, and good luck!
